# Toriality's DevLogs

**Here I'll share all my projects' progress!**

## DevLog #1 - 25.01.2023

Today is the first day writing a devlog so I think it's important to give some context.

At the moment I am working on a project in which I aim to rebuild the DYOM website (https://dyom.gtagames.nl/) from scratch.

I am using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, among other technologies for this project. If you want to contribute the code will always be open-source and the repository link is here: https://github.com/Toriality/DYOM-Website

Let's get started...

### 1. The beginning: 

The project started one day ago. At the end of that day the site had a (fairly) functional backend, and a very simple frontend full of improvements to make. Here's the result:

It is worth mentioning that the design of the project is based on a project I did at Figma that also rebuilt the DYOM site from scratch, but only visually. Link below:

### 2. Building the homepage: 

Today my focus was to start working on the homepage. Starting from the beginning, I tried to make the DYOM banner - the first thing a visitor to the site will see, so it should be pretty, eye-catching and straight to the point.

### 3. RTK Query: 

I was able to implement some authentication features using Redux-Toolkit. Currently there are functions to register a new user and login. It's in a very simple stage and far away from the structure I want to achieve in the final result, but it's good for now.
