## DevLog #18 - 12.05.2023

Hello everyone, I had a tiring day today, so I'll keep it short because I'm really looking forward to getting some rest. :smile:

### DYOM Bingo:

This morning, I focused on resolving the Pull Request suggestions from the previous days.

I'll be awaiting for feedback and testing so that I can move forward with the work.

### DYOM Server:

I'm happy to say that the server is finally finished!

Of course, there are still many features that can be added and plenty of room for improvement, but as I mentioned in my previous DevLogs, my goal was to focus on releasing the essential part of the server.

## DevLog #17 - 10.05.2023

Hello everybody!

Today was quite a productive day for the DYOM Bingo project. We have made some cool new contributions and updates.

Firstly, I started the day by making some changes that I have been wanting to make for quite some time now. I have re-organized our repository and its documentation to make it more user-friendly and... well... organized. Here are the new updates:

- **Introduction to Discussions:** We have inaugurated the Discussions feature provided by GitHub, which now provides us with an page for general discussions. It will be very beneficial for community engagement as it allows us to make suggestions, give general ideas, announce changelogs for new versions, create questions, and make simple polls.

- **Code of Conduct:** We have created a documentation outlining our repository's code of conduct, which provides a comprehensive set of guidelines on how our users should behave, in order to provide an respectful and an inclusion space for everyone in our community. [Click here to check the Code of Conduct.](https://github.com/Toriality/DYOM-Bingo/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

- **Contributing Guidelines:** We have created a detailed documentation that provides step-by-step instructions on how new contributors can properly contribute to our project. [Click here to check it out!](https://github.com/Toriality/DYOM-Bingo/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- **Templates:** We have created templates for both Issues and Pull Requests, which are optional but recommended since they help our users to format their reports in a more readable and appropriate way.

Additionally, I have also worked on an issue that covered an interesting and useful idea. [This is the requested idea](https://github.com/Toriality/DYOM-Bingo/issues/16). And I was able to open a Pull Request from this Issue on the same day! This was my first time opening a PR from an issue, so I'm really happy to have had this experience.

Overall it has been a pretty interesting day and I'm excited to see what more cool stuff will happen. Thanks for reading :smile:

## DevLog #16 - 09.04.2023

**Greetings everyone,**

It has been more than a month since my last devlog post, and I must admit I was a bit lost about how I'd write another one...

For those who might remember, my last update mentioned about me having contracted COVID-19 and that I was forced to take a break from my projects. Well, I'm happy to report that I recovered from it and I'm feeling much better :)

However, the recovery process took longer than I anticipated, and it took me a good while to get back into the swing of things. Although my motivation to write devlogs was very low, I still managed to make some interesting changes to my projects over the past few weeks.

### DYOM Bingo Updates

With the help of the contributors, I was able to make significant improvements to the site's code, particularly in terms of functionality and file structure. In fact, I have released two new versions of the site within just a month, and more, I am currently working on yet another update.

These new versions contains an improved file architecture and several new things, including a scoreboard, seeds system, card history, and even an easter egg! There are too many new features to list in a single devlog post, so if you're interested, you can check out the complete changelog on this [link](https://toriality.github.io/DYOM-Bingo/changelogs.html), and the new branch that will soon be updated on [here](https://github.com/Toriality/DYOM-Bingo/tree/1.4).

### DYOM Website Updates

To be honest, this project has been giving me some headaches even before I took a break from my projects. It is an ambitious and complex project that is quite challenging for a solo developer to undertake. Sometimes, I honestly wonder if it even makes sense to start from scratch, since that there is already a functioning site which might only requires a few tweaks and fixes to make it good and modernized.

To make things worse, the mod owners have been inactive since 2014-ish (almost a decade!), and there's no guarantee that they would even visualize any of the work I'm doing.

Despite these unanswered questions, I am **not giving up on this**.

My current plan is to focus on creating a fully functional API, with all the fundamental features working correctly. Although the front-end of the site (developed in React) may not be finished, I am determined to complete the back-end (built with NodeJS). So, in the end, we will have a fully working backend for interacting with DYOM's database!

Once both projects are finished, I will not stop contributing to DYOM, ever :). Instead, I will shift my focus to getting a job and improve skills that will help me achieve my career goals.

Thanks for reading, and I'll be back with more updates soon! ;)
