## DevLog #16 - 09.04.2023

**Greetings everyone,**

It has been more than a month since my last devlog post, and I must admit I was a bit lost about how I'd write another one...

For those who might remember, my last update mentioned about me having contracted COVID-19 and that I was forced to take a break from my projects. Well, I'm happy to report that I recovered from it and I'm feeling much better :)

However, the recovery process took longer than I anticipated, and it took me a good while to get back into the swing of things. Although my motivation to write devlogs was very low, I still managed to make some interesting changes to my projects over the past few weeks.

### DYOM Bingo Updates

With the help of the contributors, I was able to make significant improvements to the site's code, particularly in terms of functionality and file structure. In fact, I have released two new versions of the site within just a month, and more, I am currently working on yet another update.

These new versions contains an improved file architecture and several new things, including a scoreboard, seeds system, card history, and even an easter egg! There are too many new features to list in a single devlog post, so if you're interested, you can check out the complete changelog on this [link](https://toriality.github.io/DYOM-Bingo/changelogs.html), and the new branch that will soon be updated on [here](https://github.com/Toriality/DYOM-Bingo/tree/1.4).

### DYOM Website Updates

To be honest, this project has been giving me some headaches even before I took a break from my projects. It is an ambitious and complex project that is quite challenging for a solo developer to undertake. Sometimes, I honestly wonder if it even makes sense to start from scratch, since that there is already a functioning site which might only requires a few tweaks and fixes to make it good and modernized.

To make things worse, the mod owners have been inactive since 2014-ish (almost a decade!), and there's no guarantee that they would even visualize any of the work I'm doing.

Despite these unanswered questions, I am **not giving up on this**.

My current plan is to focus on creating a fully functional API, with all the fundamental features working correctly. Although the front-end of the site (developed in React) may not be finished, I am determined to complete the back-end (built with NodeJS). So, in the end, we will have a fully working backend for interacting with DYOM's database!

Once both projects are finished, I will not stop contributing to DYOM, ever :). Instead, I will shift my focus to getting a job and improve skills that will help me achieve my career goals.

Thanks for reading, and I'll be back with more updates soon! ;)
