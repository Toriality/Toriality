## DevLog #5 - 30.01.2023

Throughout the day, my main goal was on connecting the database with the front-end of the DYOM Website.

Initially I created a debug page to add new missions to the database.

After creating all the components that make up the form needed to add a new mission to the site, the focus was on integrating the file upload... and this was extremely hard to do.

After a good couple of hours, I managed to get the file upload working. It is not 100% complete but it is ready for testing.

Starting tomorrow I will finalize some details and start adding missions to test the features like data validations and organizing folders, names, etc.

What is left to be done in the code:

- A function to upload banner image
- A function to upload multiple images to the gallery
- Define an effective folder structure
- Refactor and clean up the code (which is currently a total mess)

## DevLog #4 - 28.01.2023

### DYOM Website

Taking a closer look at the navbar menu, I noticed that its design is not very modern, and the fact that it takes up the whole screen may interfere with the user experience.

I decided to follow a suggestion from a friend and made a menu that only takes up about 1/3 of the screen and is positioned at the top.

As a result, I changed almost all the code. Before I used a `<Box` that changed its visibility as needed, and now I'm using a `<Drawer>`, which is a much better alternative for this type of situation, and already has predefined animations which is a good thing.

There was, however, the loss of the general site statistics within the navigation menu.

But this was solved by transferring these statistics to the footer. It is even more elegant and unobtrusive. I think it's definitely in its right place now.

### DYOM Bingo

After these changes I decided to watch Joshimuz's live to distract myself.

He mentioned the DYOM Bingo, and that was a pretty cool thing. I watched the chat to see if there were any comments about Bingo and to my delight many people were talking about it. Some were asking if with X situation they could check X slot, some were saying they marked X slot, among other fun interactions.

One of the suggestions was to replace "Mission was made this year" with "Mission was made within a year", which makes sense since it is January and it would be almost impossible to mark this slot (Even more so since the DYOM site is having technical problems uploading new missions since the end of last year, so you could say it is an impossible slot to mark now). That said, after the live stream I went to the code to make this change.

A few minutes after I made the change, a user made a comment in my commit saying that this changed the meaning of the sentence, which could cause misinterpretation.

My solution to this was to add a helperText (function that I created a few days ago in version 1.1 of DYOM Bingo) to better explain what this slot meant.

![missionyear](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38092988/215366514-45303321-0f59-47c3-8ad1-175de9b8c6ac.png)

To create this text that specifies the dates, I had to create a const that holds the current date, and then use Template Literals in the helperText string to tell the current date and last year's date. This is how the code looks like

```javascript
// Get current date
const date = new Date();
const month = new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", { month: "long" }).format(date);
const year = date.getFullYear();

// ...[some slots]...

  {
    slotType: "Mission Info",
    string: "Mission was made within a year",
    helperText: `This mission was published between ${month}, ${
      year - 1
    } and ${month}, ${year}`,
    needsInfo: true,
  },
```

Finally, I cleaned up the code a little and added a few slots. You can check the whole source code here: https://github.com/Toriality/DYOM-Bingo

## DevLog #3 - 27.01.2023

Today there was quite a bit of progress on the homepage of the site. I was able to organize some parts of the code and create new components.

At the beginning of the day I started by organizing the code, which was a bit of a mess. I don't really like having several lines of code in a single React component file, I think it makes the code a bit hard to read for future analysis. So I decided to separate the homepage into small sub-components.

These components are:

- Banner: The image and call-to-action of the site.
- TrendingProjects: The two projects with the most clicks and interactions during the last 24 hours
- LatestNews: The most recent news.

Note that, with the exception of the Banner component, none of the other two components have their functions finished since I haven't made the client-database connection yet.

In the navigation menu (Navbar Component), I created the Menu where practically all the links of the website are. It looks like this:

![menuimg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38092988/215364210-74c3a5f3-a3eb-42c6-9185-f04ae381d927.gif)

I also made a prototype of how the TrendingProjects component would look like, it's not quite complete yet, the image is a little too big and the layout doesn't feel quite right.

Finally I created the Footer component. It currently looks like this:

![footer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38092988/215364247-3a4ed5ac-44cc-4e92-bdf6-d72393557a9b.png)

And that was all my progress for this Friday :)

## DevLog #2 - 26.01.2023

While taking a short break from DYOM Webiste, I decided to make some major changes to DYOM Bingo.

This morning at 9:00 AM I started thinking about some ideas that would be interesting for the new version of the bingo. And I came up with these ideas:

- Filters/limits: so that users who don't have certain features of newer versions of Rainbomizer can still be entertained with the bingo. For example, to mark certain slots it was necessary to have the auto-translate feature of Rainbomizer, but not all users have this version, so the filter to remove slots that need auto-translate was created
- A button to generate slots: a simple button that regenerates new slots, instead of having to reload the page
- Tooltips: some of the slots might not be very clear to understand, so when you hover the mouse over them, there will be tooltips explaining what the slot is about. This was also nice to write some interesting trivia about DYOM
- New theme: total reconstruction of the theme, with new colors and images, leaving aside that boring black and white visual that looked like a pure HTML page

All these ideas were successfully developed by the end of this afternoon. The final result? This one:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38092988/215221056-6707a58a-2e3a-45e4-a60f-b868afe97add.png)

After showing the site on the GTA Rainbomizer Discord, some users pointed out that the limit buttons were not working. Actually, what was happening was that the :has CSS was not compatible with the Firefox browser, and so when the user clicked on the filter button, there was no visual indication that it was active/deactivated.

I was able to replace the CSS :has with a slightly larger code within JavaScript, but it works just the same. The error apparently no longer occurs.

```css
.formdiv label {
  text-align: center;
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 16px 8px;
  background-color: #eee;
  border: 0.6rem solid #ccc;
}
.formdiv label:has(input:checked) {
  background-color: rgba(255, 204, 204, 0.75);
  border-color: rgba(255, 49, 49, 0.75);
}
.formdiv label:hover {
  background-color: #ffffcf;
  border-color: #ffdf70;
}
```

That's the CSS code that got replaced by this Javascript code:

```javascript
// :has alternative for Firefox
let formLabels = document.querySelectorAll(".formdiv label");
let checkboxes = document.querySelectorAll("input");
checkboxes.forEach((input) => {
  input.addEventListener("change", () => {
    let parent = input.parentElement;
    if (input.checked) {
      parent.style.backgroundColor = "rgba(255, 204, 204, 0.75)";
      parent.style.borderColor = "rgba(255, 49, 49, 0.75)";
    } else {
      parent.style.backgroundColor = "#eee";
      parent.style.borderColor = "#ccc";
    }
    parent.addEventListener("mouseenter", () => {
      if (!input.checked) {
        parent.style.backgroundColor = "#ffffcf";
        parent.style.borderColor = "#ffdf70";
      }
    });
    parent.addEventListener("mouseleave", () => {
      if (!input.checked) {
        parent.style.backgroundColor = "#eee";
        parent.style.borderColor = "#ccc";
      }
    });
  });
});
```

At the end of the day I got a big surprise.

[My post on the DYOM Twitter account](https://twitter.com/OfficialDYOM/status/1618686351842607104) about this new version of DYOM Bingo was noticed by streamer Joshimuz, who retweeted it.

Besides being a big admiration for me, [Joshimuz](https://www.twitch.tv/joshimuz) is a popular streamer and his retweet caused the post to get more than 3 thousand views and dozens of likes. Definitely something that made me very happy and proud of this modest little job for the DYOM community :) .

## DevLog #1 - 25.01.2023

Today is the first day writing a devlog so I think it's important to give some context.

At the moment I am working on a project in which I aim to rebuild the DYOM website (https://dyom.gtagames.nl/) from scratch.

I am using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, among other technologies for this project. If you want to contribute the code will always be open-source and the repository link is here: https://github.com/Toriality/DYOM-Website

Let's get started...

### 1. The beginning:

The project started one day ago. At the end of that day the site had a (fairly) functional backend, and a very simple frontend full of improvements to make. Here's the result:

![dyom1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38092988/214803680-fd3038da-61fe-445a-a5a8-9fa5a9778c12.png)

It is worth mentioning that the design of the project is based on a project I did at Figma that also rebuilt the DYOM site from scratch, but only visually. Link below:

https://www.figma.com/file/JoQWxWZ3WEO6YtLCOLtbMG/DYOM?node-id=0%3A1

### 2. Building the homepage:

Today my focus was to start working on the homepage. Starting from the beginning, I tried to make the DYOM banner - the first thing a visitor to the site will see, so it should be pretty, eye-catching and straight to the point.

![dyom2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38092988/214803857-8b916b7a-889b-4947-bab0-8914e837401d.png)

Credits to Zeko, designer of the missionpack [Katabasis](https://gtaforums.com/topic/964193-mp-katabasis/), for the banner picture.

### 3. RTK Query:

I was able to implement some authentication features using Redux-Toolkit. Currently there are functions to register a new user and login. It's in a very simple stage and far away from the structure I want to achieve in the final result, but it's good for now.
