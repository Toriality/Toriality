## Devlog #15 - 08.03.2023

I am making this devlog just to bring up to date anyone who reads it.

Unfortunately, in the last few weeks there has been almost no progress on any of my projects. The reason for this is that I got COVID-19, and the first week was extremely complicated, fever and very strong pains. I am still recovering, most of the symptoms are gone and I feel much better compared to the last week.

I feel that in a few days I will be ready to work on the projects again.
