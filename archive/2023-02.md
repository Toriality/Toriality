## Devlog #14 - 23.02.2023

We have been making some slow progress these days, but soon we will have new features and functionality on the front-end.

Today I implemented a very simple model for **TrendingProjects**.

**TrendingProjects** is a feature that currently works like this: Projects that had the highest number of views during the last 7 days will be highlighted (2 misisons, 2 missionpacks)

As I said, it is still something very simple, in the future it will have a "score" system, that is, the higher the number of interactions, the higher the score, but also considering other variables that influence this score.

## Devlog #13 - 21.02.2023

In the last few days I have been working on new features and on organizing certain stuff in the database.

First of all, it will now no longer be necessary to repeat the same codes to modify or read the missions and missionpacks database, because both were deleted to form a single database called Projects. This new database will have a discriminator key for missions and mission packs. [This significantly reduces code repetition](https://github.com/Toriality/DYOM-Website/commit/23cf8f1c05736b6241ed05ddd82b79b00107e203).

With that done, we have the first new feature on the backend after many days with no new features to present. It's the **DailyPicks**.

**DailyPicks** is a new collection in the database.

How does it work? Every day at midnight, 2 projects of the type Mission and 2 projects of the type MissionPack are randomly chosen, thus making up 4 DailyPicks.

These four projects will be displayed on the homepage of the site.

There will also be a points system in the future, where interacting with a project that is part of the current DailyPick will award the user with double the points, or something in this sense.

The central idea is to have the site providing a way to benefit as many designers as possible while increasing the engagement of the platform. All designers then have a equal chance of being selected to have a featured position for a day, gaining more visibility, while other users also benefit by receiving points that can be redeemed for other cool stuff.

This entire idea of points is still to be discussed and analyzed in order to implement it in the best possible way. You will surely hear many more changes about the points system and all the features that revolve around it. Also remember that suggestions and feedbacks are always welcome.

Lastly, another new implementation in the backend was the views function. Currently, the DYOM site increments the number of views for a project whenever someone visits the page, this includes page reloads, making it very easy for a single person to reload the page several times to boost the number of views.

We want to avoid this. Therefore the following code was made:

```js
const cookieName = `view_${type}_${id}`;
// ...more code...
if (!req.cookies[cookieName]) {
  project.updateOne({ $inc: { views: 1 } }).exec();
  res.cookie(cookieName, true, { maxAge: week });
}
```

What the code does is examine whether the user, when visiting the project page, has the cookie for the project.

If not, the number of views is incremented as usual. And a new cookie is set in the user's browser, corresponding to the project ID (e.g., `view_mission_1384`)

If it does, the number of views is not affected.

The cookie is deleted after one week, to avoid many cookies being stored on the user's browser.

Of course, this system has its flaws. The user can delete the cookies or use a private navigation, but it is still somewhat more efficient than the current system, and we can improve it in the future.

## Devlog #12 - 17.02.2023

Not much progress today, but I wanted to let you all know that I **might** take a little more time to finish organizing the components. There are only a few components left, but they are quite a lot of work.

## Devlog #11 - 16.02.2023

I was able to redo most of the components that were in need of being reusable throughout the site. There are still a few components remaining, I expect everything to be ready by tomorrow or Saturday!

While I'm doing this organization, I also took some of my time to make the profile page, and I'll have some screenshots to share in a couple days.

To have a closer look at the changes, take a look at the [project's source code](https://github.com/Toriality/DYOM-Website).

## Devlog #10 - 13.02.2023

As I promised in the last DevLog, here are some screenshots of the main new front-end features:

</details>

Please note that they are not yet 100% finished!

Well, now I feel it's time to step on the brakes a bit. It has been a lot of new features since the start of the site development up until now, and this is great for showcasing the overall style and experience of the site, but every once in a while we need to stop and analyze the structure and the code as a whole - its strengths, weaknesses, repetitions, unnecessary and obsolete code, among other things. And it will be these analysis and improvements that I will be focusing from now on.

This means that we will not have visual updates for a while, I believe it will last a week at most. But this will be very important in the long term because it will transform all the repetitive code that exists today into fully reusable components with a more efficient organization.

It is a really boring part to do, as there are almost no visual or functional changes on the site during this time, so the DevLogs will be shorter this week.

That's it, have a great day <3

Some notes for tomorrow's goals for myself to remember:

- Restructure missionSlice so that it becomes projectSlice (covering missions and mission-packs)
- Change the MissionPack model and its routing
- Make the listMissionPacks page
- Finish making the ProjectInputs component fully functional for both missions and mission-packs
- (Optional) Organize sx

## DevLog #9 - 10.02.2023

Hello again! I spent some days without having enough time to write the DevLogs, but I didn't stop programming the site during that time ;)

I'll let you all updated about everything new that was done during this period. Below, the main changes and creations made on the site:

- Mission Page: we finally reached one of the most essential sections for the DYOM site! This page renders the mission selected by the user. It shows all the information about the mission, such as title, author, description, specs and more.
- Reviews Page: Inside the mission page, you will have the ability to visualize and publish reviews. This page is not fully ready yet, there is a lot to do, but the basics and the database connection is already done. There will be many improvements to make, but I will have them done by the time I finish user details, such as a page that displays the profile, edits the profile, and other things.
- Breadcumbs: a simple navigator between previous pages, for a better user experience
- WriteReviews component: this component is a modal where the user writes a review

Among other small organization and structural improvements to the code.

Watch out for the next DevLogs, I'll be showing with pictures these new creations and much more!

## DevLog #8 - 05.02.2023

Today the site has made a lot of progress I would say.

We start with a new page created: ListMissions. As the name says, this page will show the list of missions.

Besides it there will be a small banner, indicating the page, a "Daily Picks" component and a "Pinned Projects" component. I will explain them both.

- **Daily Picks**: is a function that will be added to the site that does not currently exist on the old site. Every day a mission and a mission-pack will be chosen randomly and automatically to be the daily picks of the day. By interacting with the daily picks, the user will earn points, for example, by downloading a mission, by doing a review, among other things. The idea is to try to give opportunities to all creators equally, while moving the activity and engagement of the site, rewarding users and forming an active and loyal base. Everybody wins.
- **Pinned Projects**: These are the pinned projects, which already exist on the old site, but in a somewhat disorganized way, joining pins and normal projects in the same table. In this new design, they will be separated and compacted, but keeping a certain emphasis that they deserve.

Below are some images of this new page:

Along with the creation of the page, inevitably several new reusable components were created. This is great for organized and reusable code. These include components such as stylized boxes, page selector, filter selector, and a table that shows the projects.

Also some important adjustments were made to the backend, like the project search function and pagination. And at the end of the day, I started the connection between these backend functions and the frontend of the site, but I still haven't finished applying them completely.

Tomorrow I should finish all or a large part of the page and its components.

## DevLog #7 - 04.02.2023

Finally, I'm back with the devlogs!!!

Last week I went a few days without electricity because of a truck that passed on the street and took with it some electrical wires together :)

But now the lights are back on and I have some news to show you!

### DYOM Website

I managed to finalize the look and functionality of the add missions page. There are a few visual things I intend to change in some subcomponents, but I'll leave that for later, since they are components I'll reuse in other pages, and they are minor details.

Below is a gif demonstrating the page and one of its features of uploading images:

![Code_5OynWqRNB7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38092988/216808909-fe07ba48-9424-41c1-b706-9cf1306eb71b.gif)

The functions of the page are 100% connected to the database and it is then possible to add new missions through it.

## DevLog #6 - 31.01.2023

I have successfully managed the uploads to the database. Now the debug page can perfectly add missions to the database as it was intended to.

![MongoDBCompass_5ir7CJvo17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38092988/215996396-3a9ab6ed-b151-463d-8456-d93bf9c76c6f.png)

I also decided how the directory structure will look like.

![Code_EGKJEW6Zac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38092988/215996453-806d9602-0c6d-476c-a260-cbd9051c72a0.png)

And finally, just for testing, I made a python script to delete all the folders and files whose name does not match any ID inside the database. This is important because when a mission is deleted completely from the database, its entry there is deleted, but the files that were uploaded remain on the server, taking up important storage space. So by deleting these directories, we clean up unnecessary folders and gain more storage space.

I also made a few visual changes to the site:

![opera_g3Zk9JszCu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38092988/215996497-a7502fc5-43a0-41b4-90e1-de50dc188f64.png)

Now the idea is to create an official page to add missions, with a good look and functionality for the best user experience.
