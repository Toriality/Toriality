### Who am I?

My name is Pedro &mdash; but you can call me Toriality (or simply Tori) &mdash; I am currently finishing my bachelor's degree in **Information Systems** and I am also starting my entrepreneurial career as a **Computer Technician.**

I love solving problems and learning new things, especially computer related.

I also love cats and have a 4 year old cat named Sophia ^-^

### What am I learning?

I have two years of experience in full-stack development. My favorite language is **Javascript.**

I plan to specialize in **React**, one of my favorite front-end libraries.

My learning plans for the future are to improve my knowledge in **data security** and especially to start learning **React Native** for mobile development.
