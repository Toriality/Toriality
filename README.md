**HTML and CSS**: My first contacts with what would be the closest thing to a programming language. I always found the idea of creating my own website exciting so I decided to learn these two technologies in 2018.

**Javascript**: It is by far one of my favorite programming languages. It is so dynamic, flexible and intuitive that, for me, it is impossible not to fall in love with it. I currently have 4 years of experience in this language and 2 years of experience with frameworks like React, Material-UI and Mongoose. React is my expertise and I'm always looking to deepen my knowledge and keep up to date with all the new features that this amazing framework provides for web-apps development.

**Python**: Although it's not my strong suit, I love Python for its simplicity and for being able to solve anything from extremely complex problems to small things. I always enjoy using Python in some of my projects and even in my daily life with, for example, scripts to mass-rename files.

**Other**: NSIS, PHP, MySQL.
